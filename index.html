        <h1>Chocolate Chip Cookies</h1>
        <h3><b>History</b></h3>
        <p>The original recipe was created in the late 1930s by <b>Ruth Wakefield</b> who famously ran the Toll House restaurant in <u>Whitman, Massachusetts</u>. The recipe was made on accident, when Wakefield was trying to make a variation of a butterscotch dessert. She let the chocolate chips fall where they may, and the chocolate chip cookie was born. The delicious mix of crispy cookie and melted chocolate chunks first appeared in her 1938 cookbook <i>“Tried and True”</i> and was intended to accompany ice cream. The main ingredients are flour, sugar, brown sugar, butter or margarine, chocolate chips, eggs, vanilla, baking soda, & salt, but people have created new recipes over time.</p>
        <p>This recipe is easy, and makes chocolatey, chewy, delicious chocolate chip cookies.</p>
